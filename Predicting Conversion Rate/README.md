# Daily Practice for Coding

This project is to predict whether a user will convert to active user based on their information using Random Forest achieving an auc score of 0.98.

## Getting Started

### Packages Prerequisites

For this project, `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `PCA` packages are required.

## General guidance

The user information contains country, age, new_user or not, total_page_viewed and converted or not.

I have implemented Random Forest, PCA Regression, Logistic Regression and used cross validation to compare the performance of the above models.
