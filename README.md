# Machine_Learning_Projects
This is a record of my machine learning related projects, including museum attendance predicting, customer loyalty predicting, etc.

## Museum Attendance Predicting
This project is to predict the daily attendance for a museum. The data source includes information about museum exhibits, weather data, crime data, etc.

I have first transfromed and aggregated the exhibit-level data into a daily-level then built a Random Forest regression model using random search for parameters tuning, resulting in a 0.74 R-squared in test set.

## Customers Loyalty Predicting
This is [Elo Merchant Category Recommendation competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation) from Kaggle, which is to build a regression model to predict the customer's loyalty score (between 0 and 1).
